        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 2024-10-03</p>
        
        <p>Welcome to TUNA: The Ultimate Nutrition App ("the App"). Your privacy is important to me, and this Privacy Policy outlines how I collect, use, store, and share your information when you use the App.</p>
        
        <p>By using TUNA, you agree to the collection and use of information as described in this Privacy Policy. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to me at <a href="mailto:theultnutapp@gmail.com">theultnutapp@gmail.com</a>.</p>

        <h2>1. Information I Collect</h2>
        <p>When you use TUNA, I may collect the following types of information:</p>

        <h3>a. Personal Information</h3>
        <p><strong>Email Address:</strong> Collected during registration for account creation and login.</p>
        <p><strong>User Profile Information:</strong> This may include your name, age, gender, height, weight, dietary preferences, and other information necessary to provide personalized nutrition insights.</p>

        <h3>b. Health and Nutrition Data</h3>
        <p><strong>Food Logs and Meal Photos:</strong> You may log your meals and upload photos, which are stored in Google Cloud Storage. These meal photos are used to help you track your diet over time.</p>
        <p><strong>Nutritional Information:</strong> Collected from your food logs and analyzed to provide insights into your nutrition intake.</p>
        <p><strong>AI Analyzed Data:</strong> AI services (e.g., Gemini AI) may analyze your meal photos to provide food recognition and suggestions. I do not control the data retention policies of third-party AI services, and you should review their privacy policies as well.</p>

        <h3>c. Device and Activity Information</h3>
        <p><strong>Analytics Data:</strong> I may collect information about how you interact with the App through Firebase and Mixpanel, including in-app activity, page views, and navigation paths. This helps improve your experience by identifying which features are most useful.</p>
        <p><strong>Device Information:</strong> Basic information about your device (e.g., model, operating system) may be collected for analytics purposes.</p>

        <h2>2. How I Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>The information I collect is used to improve your experience with TUNA and provide you with personalized nutrition insights. Specifically, your data is used for the following purposes:</p>
        <p><strong>Personalized Recommendations:</strong> Based on your food logs, I provide tailored nutrition insights and recommendations.</p>
        <p><strong>App Improvements:</strong> Analytics data is used to understand user behavior and improve features. For example, I may use your interaction data to introduce new features or make navigation easier.</p>
        <p><strong>Account Management:</strong> Your email address and profile information are used for account creation, login, and user support.</p>

        <h2>3. How I Share Your Information</h2>
        <p>Your data is not sold or shared with third parties except as outlined below:</p>

        <h3>a. Third-Party Service Providers</h3>
        <p>I use several third-party services to operate the App:</p>
        <p><strong>Google Cloud Storage:</strong> Meal photos are stored in a public but controlled folder. You can delete your meal photos at any time if you prefer not to store them.</p>
        <p><strong>Firebase and Mixpanel:</strong> These services help me track user activity and provide insights on how the App is used. This data is anonymized and does not personally identify you.</p>
        <p><strong>Gemini AI:</strong> If you use the photo recognition feature, your photos are analyzed by an AI service for food identification. I do not control how long Gemini AI retains this data. Please review their privacy policy for more information.</p>

        <h3>b. Legal Requirements</h3>
        <p>I may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>I take your data security seriously. I implement industry-standard measures to protect your personal data, including encryption of sensitive data and secure storage practices.</p>
        <p><strong>Data Storage:</strong> Personal information is stored securely in the cloud, and meal photos are stored in Google Cloud Storage.</p>
        <p><strong>Encryption:</strong> Any sensitive information, such as your email or nutrition data, is encrypted both in transit and at rest.</p>

        <h2>5. User Rights</h2>
        <p>You have the following rights regarding your data:</p>
        <p><strong>Access and Update:</strong> You can access and update your personal information through the App at any time.</p>
        <p><strong>Delete Your Account:</strong> You can request that your account and all associated data (including meal photos) be deleted by contacting me at <a href="mailto:theultnutapp@gmail.com">theultnutapp@gmail.com</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Opt-Out of Analytics:</strong> If you prefer not to share anonymized analytics data, you can disable data collection in the settings.</p>

        <h2>6. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
        <p>I may use cookies or similar tracking technologies to improve user experience and track app usage. These are used for:</p>
        <p><strong>Analytics:</strong> Understanding how users navigate the App.</p>
        <p><strong>Authentication:</strong> Remembering your login credentials for faster access.</p>
        <p>You can choose to disable cookies through your device settings, but this may affect some functionality of the App.</p>

        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>TUNA is not directed at individuals under the age of 13, and I do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If I become aware that I have collected personal data from someone under 13, I will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in how the App operates or for other legal or regulatory reasons. When I update the policy, you will be notified, and the "Effective Date" at the top will be revised.</p>
        <p>If the changes are significant, I may ask for your consent to the updated Privacy Policy before continuing to use the App.</p>

        <h2>9. Contact Me</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, or if you would like to exercise your data rights, please contact me at:</p>
