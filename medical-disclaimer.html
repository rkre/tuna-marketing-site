            <h3>⚠️ Important Notice</h3>

        <h1>Medical Disclaimer</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 2024-10-03</p>
        
        <p>The information provided by TUNA: The Ultimate Nutrition App ("the App") is for general informational and educational purposes only. By using the App, you acknowledge and agree to the following:</p>

        <h2>1. No Medical Advice</h2>
        <p>The content, recommendations, and insights provided by the App, including those generated by AI, are not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. The information provided should not be relied upon for making decisions about your health or well-being. Always seek the advice of a physician, dietitian, or other qualified healthcare provider with any questions you may have regarding your diet, health, or medical conditions.</p>

        <h2>2. Personal Responsibility</h2>
        <p>The App offers personalized insights based on the data you provide, but it cannot account for every individual's unique health circumstances, dietary needs, or medical conditions. You are solely responsible for the decisions you make regarding your diet and nutrition based on the information provided by the App.</p>

        <h2>3. No Guarantee of Accuracy</h2>
        <p>While I strive to provide accurate and up-to-date information, the App may occasionally contain errors, inaccuracies, or outdated information. Nutrition science is constantly evolving, and I cannot guarantee that all recommendations align with the most current research or guidelines.</p>

        <h2>4. AI-Generated Content</h2>
        <p>Some recommendations provided by the App may be generated by artificial intelligence ("AI"), such as AI analysis of meal photos. The AI is designed to assist you, but it may not always provide accurate or personalized recommendations. The App does not take responsibility for any decisions you make based on AI-generated suggestions.</p>

        <h2>5. Consult a Healthcare Professional</h2>
        <p>Before making significant changes to your diet or nutrition, it is important to consult with a qualified healthcare provider. The App's recommendations, including diet suggestions, nutrient tracking, and meal scoring, are intended to provide general guidance and should not be interpreted as personalized medical advice.</p>

        <h2>6. Limit of Liability</h2>
        <p>You agree that the use of the App and the information provided is at your own risk. I am not responsible for any adverse effects, injuries, or damages that may result from the use or misuse of the App or its recommendations. This includes, but is not limited to, allergies, intolerances, or other dietary reactions that may occur.</p>

        <h2>7. Nutritional Goals and Recommendations</h2>
        <p>The App may offer nutrition recommendations based on a variety of dietary frameworks, including the Hadza and Mediterranean diets. These diets are supported by research but may not be appropriate for everyone. The recommendations may differ from those provided by official guidelines, such as the USDA. You are responsible for determining whether these dietary approaches are suitable for your personal health and wellness goals.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>I reserve the right to update or modify this Medical Disclaimer at any time. You will be notified of any significant changes, and continued use of the App following the posting of such changes will constitute your acceptance of the revised disclaimer.</p>
